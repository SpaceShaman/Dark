# Dark

Step into the dark side of the force and discover the secrets of the cosmos without the risk of eye damage! Our dark theme is like a journey into the depths of space - full of mysteries, unknown worlds and undiscovered galaxies. No longer fear the bright themes that blind you and cause eye strain. Now you can freely browse the web and discover new galaxies without worrying about your eye health. With us, your cosmic journey will be one of a kind and safe for your eyes.

For a better effect, I recommend installing the [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) add-on in firefox and setting the background color to #0b0e14 and the text color to #6F7480
