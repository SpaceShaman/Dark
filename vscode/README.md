# Dark Themes

Step into the dark side of the force and discover the secrets of the universe without the risk of eye damage!
In this repository you will find a consistent dark color theme for Visual Studio Code, Firefox, Thunderbird and Allacrity terminal. In the future, I plan to add a color theme for other programs. This theme was created based on [Ayu Dark Theme](https://github.com/ayu-theme/vscode-ayu). I actually only changed some colors in it, so the main thanks go to the creator of Ayu Dark Theme.

For a better effect, I recommend installing the [Dark Reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/darkreader/) add-on in firefox and setting the background color to #0b0e14 and the text color to #6F7480
